Title: Classic Snake Game

Description:
The Classic Snake Game is a web-based recreation of the popular Snake game that gained fame on early mobile phones. In this game, players control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The objective is to survive as long as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

Key Features:

Game Board: The game board is a grid-based area where the snake and food items are displayed. It's created using HTML and styled with CSS.

Snake: The snake is represented as a series of connected squares (divs) that make up its body. It starts with a single square and grows longer as it consumes food.

Food: Food items (represented as colored squares) randomly appear on the board. When the snake "eats" a food item, it grows longer, and the player earns points.

Controls: Players can control the snake's direction using arrow keys (up, down, left, right) or on-screen buttons.

Game Logic: The JavaScript code handles the game's core logic. It tracks the snake's position, checks for collisions with walls, food, or itself, updates the game state, and manages the score.

Scoring: Players earn points for each piece of food consumed. The score increases as the snake grows longer.

Game Over: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself. A "Game Over" message is displayed, along with the player's final score.

Restart: Players can restart the game by clicking a "Play Again" button, which resets the snake's position, score, and the game board.

Technologies Used:

HTML: For creating the structure of the game board.
CSS: For styling the game elements and layout.
JavaScript: For implementing the game logic, including snake movement, collision detection, and scoring.
Event listeners: Used to capture user input for controlling the snake.
Randomization: To generate the position of food items.
DOM manipulation: To update the game board and display messages.
Additional Features (Optional):

High Score: You can add a high score feature to keep track of the player's best performances.
Speed Control: Implement different levels of difficulty by adjusting the snake's speed.
Sound Effects: Enhance the gaming experience with sound effects for eating food and collisions.
